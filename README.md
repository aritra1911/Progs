This a repository made mainly to keep track of my computer practical file which is checked after completion of any particular chapter. This is full of C++ program files written for a backdated compiler called Turbo C++. It's hard if you don't have a 32-bit windows operating system to run these files exactly, but you can always modify them to be compatible with other compilers like gc++, etc. Another reason for this repository is that I am new to Git and still under practice, so I thought this would be a good way. Feel free to Fork / Clone.

Thanks for checking out this repository. Have a nice day.
